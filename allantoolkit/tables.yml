stop_ratios:
  # Table of Stable32 Stop Ratios
  #
  # Stable32 `octave` and `decade` stability runs use a maximum averaging
  # factor determined by the number of data points and the variance type.
  # Each variance type is assigned a stop ratio as shown in Table III, and the
  # maximum averaging factor for a given stability run is determined by the
  # number of data points divided by  this  stop  ratio [RileyEvolution]_
  # (pg.9 Table III)
  #
  # max(AF) = len(data) // stop_ratio

d_order:
  # Table of differencing orders for different variance types.
  #
  # There are two categories of stability variances: unmodified variances,
  # which  use  d^th differences of phase samples, and modified variances,
  # which use d^th differences of averaged phase samples. The Allan variances
  # correspond to d = 2, and the Hadamard variances to d = 3.
